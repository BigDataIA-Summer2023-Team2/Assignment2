The notebook uses the Deduplication Dataset 2020, which consists of 100,000 scholarly documents. 
The dataset contains information such as core_id, DOI, original abstract, original title, processed title, processed abstract, category, and labelled duplicates.
The goal of the notebook is to create a data deduplication application for eliminating near-duplicate copies of academic texts. 
It performs the deduplication in two steps: similarity search and near-duplication detection.

The Vector representation of the texts to perform a similarity search. 
It uses the SentenceTransformer library and the Average Word Embedding GloVe model to generate embeddings for the texts.

Pinecone is a vector database used for storing and querying the embeddings. 
It connects to the Pinecone environment, creates or retrieves an index named ‘deduplication’, and inserts the embeddings into the index.
After indexing the embeddings, it creates a test set by sampling articles from the dataset. 
It queries the Pinecone index to retrieve the most similar articles for each test article.
It calculates the retrieval recall, which measures the effectiveness of the similarity search by comparing the retrieved articles with the labelled duplicates.

A deduplication classifier based on Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to detect duplicates among the retrieved articles.
It creates MinHash signatures for each article and uses an LSH index to find potential duplicates based on the similarity of the signatures.
It compares the predicted duplicates with the labelled duplicates from the dataset and calculates the accuracy of the classifier.

•	The similarity search achieves a high retrieval recall, with a mean of approximately 0.97 and a standard deviation of 0.16. This indicates that the search successfully retrieves a large portion of the labelled duplicates for the test articles.
•	The deduplication classifier based on LSH is applied to a sample of the query results. It compares the predicted duplicates with the labelled duplicates and calculates the accuracy.
