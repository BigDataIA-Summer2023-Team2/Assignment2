## Project Flow 

The application will serve as a valuable tool for financial analysts, enabling them to efficiently search for relevant information within earnings call transcripts.
To accomplish this goal, we will use a combination of tools and technologies. Clous SQL will be utilized as the data storage solution, ensuring seamless and efficient data management. Airflow, a robust data retrieval and processing platform, will facilitate the retrieval and transformation of earnings call transcript data. Streamlit, a user-friendly framework, will be employed to develop an intuitive front-end application. To enhance data accessibility and scalability, relevant metadata will be extracted from the data source and stored in a PostgresSQL database.
We aim to deliver a high-quality, user-friendly application that empowers financial analysts at Intelligence Co to unlock the full potential of earnings call transcripts in their research and decision-making processes.
